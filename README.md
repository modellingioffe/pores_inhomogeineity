## Pores inhomogeineity measure

Pores inhomogeneity mesure is based on calculation of inhomogeneity factor *h* (Schilcher et al. (2008)). This factor characterized deviation of the local pore density *ρ<sub>l</sub>* from the value of the average (expected) pore density *ρ*, which corresponds to the number of pores *n* per cross-section divided by the cross-sectional area of the sample.
