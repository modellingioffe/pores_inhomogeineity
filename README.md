## Pores inhomogeineity measure

Pores inhomogeneity mesure is based on calculation of inhomogeneity factor *h* (Schilcher et al. (2008)). This factor characterized deviation of the local pore density *ρ<sub>l</sub>* from the value of the average (expected) pore density *ρ*, which corresponds to the number of pores *n* per cross-section divided by the cross-sectional area of the sample.

### Inhomogeneity calculation 
Inhomogeineity is calculated using approach proposed in Schilcher, U., Gyarmati, M., Bettstetter, C., Chung, Y.W., Kim, Y. H. 2008. Measuring inhomogeneity in spatial distributions. In: Proceedings of IEEE 67th Vehicular Technology Conference, Marina Bay, Singapore, pp. 2690-2694.

### Functionality
Three options are available:
* calculatoin of inhomogeinity for pores, that are considered dots;
* calculation of inhomogeinity for pores that have different radii;
* calculation of inhomogeinity for random uniform distirbution.
