## inhomogeineity calculation

Inhomogeineity is calculated using approach proposed in Schilcher, U., Gyarmati, M., Bettstetter, C., Chung, Y.W., Kim, Y. H. 2008. Measuring inhomogeneity in spatial distributions. In: Proceedings of IEEE 67th Vehicular Technology Conference, Marina Bay, Singapore, pp. 2690-2694. 


### Functionality 
Three options is available:
* calculatoin of inhomogeinity for pores, that are considered dots;
* calculation of inhomogeinity for pores that have different radii;
* calculation of inhomogeinity for random uniform distirbution.
